To set up the lego demo:
close curtains
position table to align with tape.
Position white cardboard so that horizontal lines align with close edge of table and left edge is 3 lego units from left edge of table. Then shift left edge slightly forward (otherwise sheet will be detected as lego)
Cover with white sheet
Can verify that it aligns in rviz (look at MarkerArray-collision_environment_marker)
